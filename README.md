## EXPLAIN VERSION CONTROl

  - VERSION CONTROL - also known as source control or revision control- is an important software development practice for tracking and managing changes made to code and other files. Version control serves as a safety net to protect the source code from irreparable harm, giving the development team the freedom to experiment without fear of causing damage or creating code conflicts.
  If developers code concurrently and create incompatible changes, version control identifies the problem areas so that team members can quickly revert changes to a previous version, compare changes, or identify who committed the problem code through the revision history. With a version control system (VCS), a software team can solve an issue before progressing further into a project.Through code reviews, software teams can analyze earlier versions to understand the changes made to the code over time.
